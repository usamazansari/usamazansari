Frontend Developer | Backend Enthusiast | Cloud Wizard | Code Juggler

Welcome to the world where coding magic happens, bugs turn into features, and all while keeping a good sense of humor. 🪄

## About Me

🌟 I'm a **Frontend Developer** who can make pixels dance to my code tunes.
🚀 I've conquered the front-end world with my spells, including **Angular**, **React**, and **Astro**.
🧙‍♂️ I've dabbled in the mystical arts of **NestJS**, **ExpressJS**, and even a bit of **Python** for backend sorcery.

## Skills

💡 I'm not just a one-trick pony; I'm a multi-talented code wizard:
- ✨ Experienced in **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration.
- ☁️ I can summon and tame clouds on **GCP** and **AWS** like a pro.
